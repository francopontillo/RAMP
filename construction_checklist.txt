GARAGE RAMP CONSTRUCTION CHECKLIST
======================================================================

PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS:
  Ramp Length: 12.0m horizontal
  Vertical Drop: 2.8m
  Ramp Width: 3.0m
  Profile: Cubic spline (smooth curve)
  Maximum Slope: 19.3° (at midpoint)

PRE-CONSTRUCTION:
  [ ] Obtain necessary permits
  [ ] Mark all utility lines (call before you dig!)
  [ ] Verify measurements on site
  [ ] Order materials (see specifications)
  [ ] Arrange concrete delivery timing
  [ ] Set up site safety barriers

SITE PREPARATION:
  [ ] Clear area of debris and vegetation
  [ ] Establish reference point at street level
  [ ] Mark centerline with string line or laser
  [ ] Set measurement stakes every 0.5m (25 stakes total)
  [ ] Mark depth at each stake per measurement table
  [ ] Excavate to required depth + 150mm for base

BASE PREPARATION:
  [ ] Install drainage channels on both sides
  [ ] Place and compact 100mm gravel base
  [ ] Verify base levels match profile
  [ ] Ensure proper slope for water drainage

FORMWORK:
  [ ] Build side forms to 3m width
  [ ] Set form top edges to match profile elevations
  [ ] Option A: Use flexible material for smooth curve
  [ ] Option B: Use stepped formwork every 0.5m
  [ ] Brace formwork securely every 1m
  [ ] Double-check all elevations
  [ ] Ensure smooth transitions (no bumps!)

REINFORCEMENT:
  [ ] Cut and bend rebar as required
  [ ] Install 12mm rebar grid at 300mm spacing
  [ ] Maintain 50mm concrete cover
  [ ] Tie all intersections securely
  [ ] Use rebar chairs to maintain height
  [ ] Final inspection before pour

CONCRETE POUR:
  [ ] Verify concrete mix design (min 32 MPa)
  [ ] Have sufficient crew for continuous pour
  [ ] Pour concrete in systematic sections
  [ ] Vibrate thoroughly to eliminate voids
  [ ] Screed surface to match profile curve
  [ ] Float surface smooth
  [ ] Apply broom finish for traction
  [ ] Check edges and transitions

CURING & FINISHING:
  [ ] Cover with plastic sheeting
  [ ] Keep moist for minimum 7 days
  [ ] Remove formwork carefully (after 2-3 days)
  [ ] Fill any small voids or gaps
  [ ] Seal edges if required
  [ ] Allow full cure (28 days) before heavy use

FINAL CHECKS:
  [ ] Verify profile matches design (use template)
  [ ] Check drainage function
  [ ] Test drive with actual vehicle (SLOW!)
  [ ] Check for any scraping points
  [ ] Verify entry and exit transitions are smooth
  [ ] Clean up site
  [ ] Document completion with photos

SAFETY NOTES:
  ⚠ Maximum slope of 19.3° - take care during construction
  ⚠ Ensure adequate drainage to prevent ice formation
  ⚠ Smooth curve is critical - no bumps or dips
  ⚠ Consider professional consultation for this complex curve
