I want to design a slope for my cars to enter my garage.

The street is at a higher plane.
The garage is at a lower plane, 2.8m below the higher plane.
The linear path must have a maximum length of 12m.
I need a curve that outlines a smooth transition that allows a car with the following measures to get by:
997.1 generation of porsche 911, manufactured in 2008.
Length 4461mm
Ground clearance 106mm
Distance between axles 2350mm
